BatMenu looks for batch files (*.bat) in the current working directory. It then creates a button menu from which to launch these batch files.

The batch files must be autonomous -- they cannot require any arguments or user interaction. Output from the batch files will be captured in a separate window.

The title of the button window can be controlled by creating the file "batmenu.cfg" containing the title text.
